I'm Tyler, and I'm a second-year studying Computer Science and Statistics (double major) at the University of California, Berkeley. I was born and raised in Singapore, where I spent 2 years after high school serving my military service as an underwater combat medic in the Navy before beginning my university studies at Cal. I'm passionate about exploring software engineering, AI/ML, and data science. I also like reading about history, hiking, and playing Civ VI in my spare time.

Some stuff I've been doing recently are:
- 🏫 &nbsp; Learning more deep learning and software engineering
- 💻 &nbsp; Working on a contract project with Github, as a member of the [Student Association for Applied Statistics (SAAS)](https://saas.berkeley.edu/). Helping Github develop an automated repository classification system using Natural Language Processing
- 💼 &nbsp; Worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Singapore's Institute of Infocomm Research this past 2023 summer
- 🧪 &nbsp; Building a couple of Telegram bots
- 📖 &nbsp; Attempting to keep up a regular reading habit
